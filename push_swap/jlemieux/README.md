# 42_push_swap
My version of Push_swap for the 42 School of programming.

A program that sorts a stack of integers in ascending order using only a set of predefined instructions.

You can only rotate or reverse rotate a stack, swap the first two elements of a single stack or push the first element of a stack to the other one.

The maximum score (number of moves) to get 100% for 100 values is 700, and for 500 values it is 5500.

My program averages 575 moves for 100 values and 5200 for 500 values.

Best result for 100 values: 498
Best result for 500 values: 4900
